## Use this bot if you need to:

This bot was built with __Python 3__, and is meant to be __deployed by yourself via Heroku__ (hence the `Procfile`).

The bot will expect an environment variable `BOT_TOKEN`. The name is self-explanatory: __*provide your bot token as a env variable on heroku (or any other deployment method you choose)*__.
